/**
 * PWA choice: hand-rolled minimal service worker (public/sw.js) + manual registration
 * (see components/ServiceWorkerRegister.tsx), instead of the `next-pwa` package.
 * Same rationale as koraa/next.config.js — next-pwa's webpack plugin has spotty
 * support for the Next.js App Router build pipeline (14.x) and adds a heavy
 * dependency chain that is prone to install failures in constrained/offline
 * environments. A hand-rolled SW that just caches the app shell + static assets
 * is simpler, has zero extra deps, and is fully under our control.
